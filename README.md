### Data Cleaning

 in the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
 1. data loading and inseption
 2. data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Here are the steps and insights gained from performing EDA on the Coffee Shop Sales & Order Performance Analysis:

1. How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?

2. Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?

3. Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?


### Data Analysis

include some interesting code/features worked with

```MYSQL

SELECT ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) as Total_Sales 
FROM coffee_shop_sales 
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5 -- for month of (CM-May);
;
```

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
Coffee sales likely show growth over time, with weekends and certain weekdays being the busiest. Regular coffee sells the most, while premium items contribute significantly to revenue. Use these insights to optimize staffing, inventory, and promotions.

### Summary

The dataset from "Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx" contains transactional data for Maven Roasters. It includes details on sales amounts, order IDs, product types, and transaction dates. This data is used to analyze sales trends, identify the busiest days, and evaluate the performance of different products over a specific period.

### Recommendation 

Based on the analysis, We recommend the following actions:
1. Increase staff and inventory on busy days.
2. Promote popular items like regular coffee.
3. Highlight high-revenue premium products.
4. Boost sales during slow periods with targeted promotions.
5. Optimize inventory based on sales trends.

### Limitations 

1. The dataset has limitations, including missing data, lack of customer information, a short time frame, no cost details, and not accounting for external factors.
